## Overview

In this project, I learned how Google Chrome extensions work. With this knowledge, anyone is able to perform a harmless prank on someone (like a friend) by injecting and executing a script on their Google Chrome webpages.

## Steps

1. Create a directory called "image-converter". If you want this script to be as hidden as possible, you will want to name this directory to something that sounds important or necessary like "Chrome Extension" or "Chrome Helper".
2. Create a file called "manifest.json" and another file called "index.js" in that directory.
3. Create a file called "index.js" in that directory.
4. Copy and paste the scripts provided below (in the section called "Scripts") into the files.
5. Navigate to chrome://extensions, turn on "Developer Mode", click "Load unpacked", and then upload your directory.
6. ???
7. Profit

## Scripts

TODO: Add scripts here.
